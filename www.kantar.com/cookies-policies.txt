The Kantar Group Limited ("Kantar" or "We") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.  As a global business, Kantar is committed your privacy, and our obligations under the data protection laws which apply in your region (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)). 

 

This policy sets out the basis on which we process personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us on www.kantar.com (“our site”).

 

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

COOKIES

Please refer to our Cookie Policy for information on our use of cookies. 

WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

 

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and/or stored outside your territory. It may also be processed by staff operating outside your territory who work for us or for one of our suppliers. If your personal data is transferred to, stored at or otherwise processed outside your country or territory, and that country or territory has not been recognised as providing an adequate level of data protection, we will put in place additional safeguards to protect your personal data, as required by applicable law.  For example, if you are in the EEA, standard contractual clauses would be used if we process your data outside the EEA.

KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We limit access to the information by our own employees, contractors, site service providers and those individuals who are authorised for the proper handling of such information. We request that our third party contractors and site service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
