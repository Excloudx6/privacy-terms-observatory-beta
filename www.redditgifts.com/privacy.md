Why are young men giving up on dating?

The title isn't what I originally posted, but my post kept on being removed.

I thought it would be better to ask on this sub instead of r/datingadvice, because I think the replies from this sub would be much more understanding.

I've just been watching a video on YouTube about how a lot of young men are leaving society, and this is something I've very recently done as well.

I had to really weight up the pros and cons of doing this, but last week I decided to unfollow every girl on my Instagram account. It's not because I'm misogynistic, because I'm not that at all. It's more to do with how the average man is shown how easily disposable he is. How dating apps have completely ruined the dating market. There's a lot more reasons as to why I've just decided to go my own way.

The constant feeling of wanting affection all stems from social media. I came to the realisation that I'm doing nothing but wasting my time by talking to girls that only want to talk on Instagram, but wouldn't even pick up the phone for a call, let alone meet up. It's a waste of time watching their stories and liking their pictures, because that's time and effort that I could be putting towards my hobbies.

I'm a 23 year old guy, and I don't think this subject is talked about anywhere near as much as it should be. But why is that? This is a problem that will only get worse over time, and the stats for that don't lie either.

Has anyone else decided to do this as well?

EDIT: I probably won't be able to reply to all of the comments, but when I get some spare time, I'll try my best to reply to everyone. If I don't reply to you, I'll read your comment and upvote it. I don't like putting posts up and not replying or, at the very least, acknowledging the comments.

Edit 2: I'm getting comments every second. This is crazyüòÇ I guess it just goes to show that basically most men have given up on dating. There's no way I'll be able to get round to reading all of the comments, but I wish all of you the best‚úåÔ∏è
