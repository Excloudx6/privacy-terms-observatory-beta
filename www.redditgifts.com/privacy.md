The USA is on the verge of collapse

I’m in my early 30s and pretty much all of my friends from high school are either living with their parents still or are living alone and struggling. I don’t know anyone my age who has a comfortable life with a house and can pay all their bills. We all came from middle class suburban families. Most of us went to college. We ate our veggies and prayed to Jesus.

And I know way more people are even worse off. Homeless camps are set up at every overpass in my city. It was rare to see a homeless person where I live when I was a kid. Now they’re everywhere. It can’t be their fault. It’s not a “bootstraps” problem.

I get the sense something really big is about to go down. Housing and cost of living is off the charts expensive. You need at least 2 high paying incomes to buy a house now. Corpos snatch them up and rent them out at a huge markup.

There is no way any of this is sustainable. Everyone pretends they’re fine. No one is actually fine except for the boomers with juicy pensions who pretend like they’re just better at working than everyone else.

Part of me wishes the collapse would start now so we can get it over with. But I know it won’t be pretty. I wish there was a way to salvage everything without anything catastrophic happening. But I’ve thought about it back to front. There’s no other way. There just isn’t.
