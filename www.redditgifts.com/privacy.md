I feel like my music rotation is stuck in the 90s and 2000s. What great new artists have come out in the last 10 years?
discussion

Any style, I mostly listen to old school hip hop, trance/edm, indie rock and funk but I'm open to all suggestions! Repost due to auto moderator bot killing my first one.

Edit: Thank you for all the suggestions, I'm creating a queue with all these artists, please keep them coming!
