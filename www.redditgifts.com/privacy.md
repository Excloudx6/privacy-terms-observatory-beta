My husband is pushing me to agree to make my sister our surrogate using the traditional way.

My husband and I have been struggling with infirtility , We've tried some options and right now we're looking into Surrogacy, My sister agreed to do it but my husband said he looked at how much time and money IVF would take and slowly started hinting that we take the traditional way. I was too shocked to even say anything but he acted like what he said was not even that big of a deal. He explained that it's just a quick way for us to have a baby and spare the money and time to use later. I'm 100 percent against it, that is way I'm backing down and am no longer comfortable with this whole surrogacy route...I can't even imagine my sister's reaction once she hears my husband's suggestion. I'm both devastated over the fact that 1, he'd even entertain having sex with my sister just because he wants the easy way and 2, if I ever agree despite feeling unconfortable then I will always carry this memory of how the baby is conceived. I refused and shut his suggestion down hard. He's now started guilting me saying I don't trust him then saying I'm selfish for choosing to back out when he still wants to be a dad like he expected when he married me. Basically blaming me for my infirtility issues.

I feel so devasted and like my body is useless and has failed me to the point where I could expect any negative comment on it wether true on not. emotionally and mentally... I just can't express how I feel right now.

by the way my sister is 4 years younger than me. I'm 34 years old and my husband is 37.

Do most women change into their pajamas or comfy (unflattering) clothes as soon as they get home?
/r/all

When I get home from work the first thing I do is change into my pajamas. Take my bra off. Get comfy. My boyfriend has recently complained about this, saying that it isn't "sexy." Like the other day I was getting into bed and he just looked at me and said "that is the least sexy outfit I've ever seen." It really hurt my feelings. I mean it was just an oversized gray t shirt and shorts. Why does it matter what I wear at home? Is this normal?

EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this to get so much attention! Thank you all for your kind words! And even if your words weren't so kind, I still appreciate the input! Thank you all for the awards and the upvotes! It's wonderful that there's a community out there where we can ask these questions and feel safe. I appreciate all of you and wish you the best! I wish I could reply to each individual comment, but there's just too many! Thanks again!
