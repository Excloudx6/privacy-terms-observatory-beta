Game Thread - Super Bowl LVI - Los Angeles Rams (12-5, NFC) vs Cincinnati Bengals (10-7, AFC) at SoFi Stadium - 3:30p PT/6:30 ET
[GDT] 
WELCOME TO SUPER BOWL LVI

This year, the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals will face off for what should be a competitive match. For the second straight year, the pre-selected neutral site ends up being the home stadium for one of the two teams competing for the Lombardi trophy.

Matchup Information

Pre-game show starts at 3p Pacific.

Location	Time	TV	Announcers
SoFi Stadium - Inglewood, CA	3:30p PT/6:30p ET	NBC/Telemundo/CTV,TSN,RDS	Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth

Weather is projected to be 79F (26.1C) at puck drop

Team Information

The AFC Champions Cincinnati Bengals (10-7), led by coach Zac Taylor, will be playing in their third SB, first since 1988. The Bengals entered this season amongst the unlikeliest to be here, yet here they are. Led by 2020 1OA QB Joe Burrow (of LSU fame), they will look to put some serious money into the hands of the loyal fans who bet on a +10000 odds for their team to win it all this year.

Fun Fact: Joe Burrow was born during the 1996-97 NHL season, the first the Coyotes started play (as the Phoenix Coyotes) and the last the Hartford Whalers would play in Connecticut.

The NFC Champions Los Angeles Rams (12-5), led by coach Sean McVay, will be playing in their fifth Super Bowl, 2nd since moving back to LA from St. Louis. In the 2021-22 season, longtime QB Jared Goff, 2 1st round picks, and a 3rd round pick were traded to the Detroit Lions for QB Matthew Stafford - known childhood friend of Los Angeles Dodgers star Clayton Kershaw.

Fun Fact: While grass-hockey will not feature a rubber puck, it will feature a Cooper Kupp.
