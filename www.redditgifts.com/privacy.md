You should be way, WAY more concerned with the fact that you're going to die.

It blows my mind that almost everyone isn't way more concerned out about their inevitable death.

"It's part of life"

"Everyone dies."

"There's nothing you can do about it, so why worry?"

WHY WORRY? In the nearly boundless existence of space and time, we're alive for only an instant in the grand scheme of things. Billions of years before your birth, and billions of years after. And possibly.... infinitely in both directions. There may have been an infinite amount of time before your birth, and there may be an infinite amount of time after your death.

The fact of the matter is, once you die? It's over. For eternity, you will never exist again. You get about 60 to 80 years of life, and then you're dead forever.

"Well, when you're dead, you can't be sad or upset about your death."

YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I FIND SO FUCKING UPSETTING. I find no comfort in the fact that I won't care that I'm dead. It's the complete opposite, I'm terrified by an eternity of neutrality. There is no good, there is no bad. There. is. NOTHING. If Hell wasn't described in such a terrifying, painful manner - I would opt for it. I would take an eternity of sadness and emptiness long before I would take an eternity of nothingness.

I remember being 18 and being consumed by the thought. It overwhelmed me for months. I cried saying "how the fuck is anyone OK with this?" many times.

My unpopular opinion is that it's INSANE that humans as a species aren't freaking the fuck out about their inevitable death. I mean, I do. I worry about it. If I was a very intelligent person with motivations, I'd spend my entire life searching for a "cure", or at the very least a way to delay the eternal darkness until I was ready for it.

I know it doesn't do any good, but for those people who have the intelligence and the drive? Surely their anxiety about death would ABSOLUTELY do some good. I'm only 30 but I have a legal will - if I die my body is to be frozen with the virtually non-existent chance that I can be brought back to life some day.

I wish I was religious for this exact reason. The fact of the matter is I WANT there to be a God. Irony aside, I PRAY that there is a god. I hope that one day I see a ghost, no matter how terrifying it may be. Because I could at least find comfort in the fact that you exist beyond your body. Like I said, even if it's some terrifying lonely, empty existence - AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT FUCKING ERASED FROM THE UNIVERSE.

I really, really don't want to die.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Edit: This has come up a lot, and I don't want to reply to this specific comment anymore. My fear of death is not something that dominates my life. I work a great job, I LOVE my hobbies and my friends. I'm not cowering underneath my fucking bed 24/7 crying about impending doom. My point is not that we should let the inevitable dominate our lives. More so that we should incorporate the fear of being dead into our lives just as much as we do the fear of dying.

The fear of dying is hugely normalized. Through treating illness, preventing suicide, trying to stop wars.... The fear of being dead is nonexistent. My unpopular opinion is that we should all be afraid of it. Not that it needs to dominate our lives.

Everyone in this comment section is afraid of getting cancer. I'd venture to say 100% of you aren't living your lives in absolute terror of cancer. I am not living my life in absolute terror of death. It just BAFFLES me that "being dead" is not a much more prominent worry in our lives

Glad to have spoken with so many of you in chat.

It's started in Russia. In Nizhnekamsk, workers of the Hemont plant staged a spontaneous strike due to the fact that they were not paid part of their salaries as a result of the sharp collapse of the ruble.
