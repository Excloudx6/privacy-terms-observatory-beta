I found out that my husband is storing sealed jars of his diarrhea

I only found this out a few hours ago and I’m not sure how to deal with this, so any help or advise is appreciated…

While cleaning out the kitchen pantry I (24f) was dusting the top shelf (which I can’t see on top of), and noticed the clanging of jars up there. So I got out the step ladder and up there is fourteen jars filled to the brim with diarrhea and sealed with lids. The consistency in the jars ranges from brown water to a thick black sludge (like a mixture of blended slugs), and the jars are arranged in order from most watery to most viscous. I only know it’s diarrhea in the jars because I made the mistake of opening out and the stench is unmistakably the same as what he leaves behind in the bathroom. The smell was so bad I can still feel it burning the back of my throat.

I only live with my husband (42m) and he has “grim and gruesome” IBS-D (his words), but I’m just lost for words as to why he would poo into jars to be sealed and kept?! Do I tell him what I’ve found? Do I just get rid of them?
