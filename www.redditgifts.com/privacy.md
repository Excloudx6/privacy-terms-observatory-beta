I had no idea how badly transwomen were treated until I started getting mistaken for a trans woman.
/r/all

I’m in my late twenties and working in healthcare right now.

I was born a woman, but I enjoy looking androgynous, so I have short hair, and I work out, so I have a muscular build. I also have a deep voice for a woman. I LOVE looking androgynous and don’t feel bad about it. I also have a gender neutral name.

In the past year, people have begun mistaking me for a trans woman.

— I went to a doctor’s appointment. The doctor (female) asked me my pronouns. I said, “She/her.” The doctor began referring to me exclusively as male. She gave me some bad news and I began crying and hugging my husband (who was attending the appointment with me). She became extra shitty and asked me to stop and hurry up so she could get on with the appointment. I assumed that the doctor was just an asshole… I later found out she marked on my intake forms that I was MTF (male to female transgender). At the time, I had no idea what was going on, but afterwards, I realized she was trying to misgender by referring to me as male and was being shitty because she was transphobic.

— I had to stay overnight in the hospital. I told them I was a woman. They tried to put me in a room with a dangerous male psych patient. I explained that, per hospital policy, I shouldn’t be housed with a male roommate. They insisted I “had to be” because I was “technically biologically male.” I explained, no, I was born a woman. This is so fucked up to me— what if I was a trans woman? Why the fuck would they be putting a female-presenting trans woman in a room with a dangerous male psych patient?

— I have been called a faggot.

— A male patient at the nursing home commented on how he could see my erection through my pants. I had to explain that I do not have an erection because I was born female. Even if I did have a dick, why the hell is this man commenting on my genitals?

There’s more, but I don’t want to go through it all.

Anyway, solidarity for my trans sisters. Y’all have it rough. Genuinely baffled people think it’s okay to call me a faggot, be shitty to me during doctor’s appointments, and talk about my genitals.

EDIT:

Some people have looked at my post history, and they keep pointing out that I am non-binary, and l deliberately dress androgynously, so I should expect that people are confused about my biological sex.

I want to be clear about this: I am completely fine with people being confused about my biological sex.

I am not okay being called a faggot.

I don’t care that people think I’m a trans woman. I’m happy with how I look and I love being androgynous. People shouldn’t be harassing me. Trans women shouldn’t be harassed.
