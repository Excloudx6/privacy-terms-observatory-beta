There Won’t Be A War In Ukraine Because Russia Already Won
Shitpost

These are the opinions of a person that comes from a culture very similar to that of Russia and you Westerners need to start understanding just how different we view things.

Russia’s objectives was never to start an open conflict with Ukraine, it was to increase its influence in the region, particularly amongst the states that once formed the Soviet Block and due to the utter buffoonery of the United States, Russia’s plan is a bigger success than it could ever have hoped for. Let me explain.

You see, unlike the USA, Russia and other eastern countries don’t view open conflict as a preferred solution. Why? Because we don’t treat war as a business model. We prefer cleaner, and longer lasting options. Just think about it, Russia has nothing to gain from going to war and almost everything to lose. Just look at their investment into the Nord Stream pipelines and how their GDP is dependent on oil and LNG exports and you know I’m right.

The biggest mistake America and its Western allies always make time and time again with Russia and China is to think that conflict will always be a militaristic one, but in reality, trolling and subversion can have a far greater impact than any army ever could, and Russia, just trolled the fuck out of the US. By moving part of its army close to the Ukrainian border and acting somewhat hostile but not hostile enough for it to trigger open conflict, Russia was able to get a knee-jerk emotional response from the United States. This came in the form of rapid deployment of troops and the supply of armaments, but most importantly, it caused warmongering rhetoric from the current administration. And this, is what Russia really wanted.

You see, Ukraine was always concerned about Russian aggression, but never concerned enough to cause widespread panic amongst its populace, and believe it or not, they are more focused on domestic and economic issues rather than Putin’s shenanigans. This is because unlike the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ukraine’s current government is fully in control of the country and Ukrainians are more united than ever, so the prospect of a full-scale Russian invasion that will result in the deaths of millions will always be a microscopic one.

But that is not what the US thinks. The US, thinking that conflict can only ever be solved through who has the most guns, immediately started beating the war drums and Joe Biden even went as far as to create a literal fucking date for the invasion which was originally this Wednesday before moving it to this Saturday. This kind of rhetoric is carried by the corporate media for the entire world to see and spread and fear and panic amongst global investors. That fear and panic got so fucking bad, it literally ends up causing the Ukrainian economy to go into freefall, costing the country untold billions of dollars’ worth of damages every day. It has now gotten so bad; the fear being spread by US media is now doing more damage than the actual Russians. Don’t believe me? Check out this chart of the Ukrainian Hryvnia to the USD.

Want more proof? David Arakhamia, the leader of Ukraine’s parliament said the following: "There is always a threat from the outside. But! Remember the escalation last spring? Today's situation is no worse than that - it's roughly in the same range, Why is the Western media making such a big deal out of it? It's hard to say," Arakhamia remarked. Any surprises can be expected from [Moscow], we must be ready for anything, but not amplify panic.

This is diplomat speak telling the US media to shut the fuck up.

Now for the icing on the cake, even the Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement, asking Western media outlets to put out dates of which Russia will invade Ukraine so that Russian diplomats can schedule their vacations around it. They are fucking laughing at you.

Don’t even make me get started on Ukraine’s own president trolling social media by posting that he expects an imminent invasion later this week, which he later clarified to be a joke designed to target the fear mongering caused by the US media.

Now you might be asking yourself, why does this make Russia the winner? Because it damages US credibility and causes its allies in the region to question the ability of the US to protect their interests. Right now, the United States is causing panic that is crippling Ukraine’s economy and all Russia has to do is to say to the Russian population how justifiable its military exercises are because of how radical the West has become. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are already hammering out a diplomatic solution without the US at the table. The Ukrainian president already heavily hinted that they will not be joining NATO, saying that a NATO membership is akin to “having a dream” and Russia in turn is openly supporting recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both situated in eastern Ukraine as independent states, which mean Russian backed rebels will finally stop fighting Ukrainian troops. This would mean that not only, will Ukraine probably never join NATO, Russia just secured another buffer zone against the west via the formation of two new independent countries. Countries, that Russia almost have complete control over.

What’s more is that other countries in the region are openly seeing the damage the US is causing and are most likely privately questioning whether or not it’s a good idea to get the US involved in their affairs if Russia decides to become aggressive again in the future, and they will. Why? Let’s say you’re Lithuania, a NATO country and Russia starts doing their ‘military exercises’ along your eastern border. You can call in the US, but if you do, chances are, the US is going to cause far greater economic harm than Russia ever could. So what are you most likely going to do? Call in the US and watch as their media tanks your economy or just sit down with the Russians and hammer out a diplomatic solution so you both keep chugging along and tell the US to fuck off if it pokes its head into your internal affairs? It’s not a hard decision.

In summary, this is death by a thousand cuts. Russia is going to keep on chipping away at the faith ally countries have both in NATO and the US until they view these two things as borderline obsolete. So, without firing a single shot, Russia can eliminate, through time, NATO and American influence in the region all the while forming its own deals and alliances until it is once again the biggest player in that region.

Another aspect as to why Russia has already won that is not discussed nearly enough is the imminent signing of the new Iranian nuclear deal. Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran’s lead negotiator just publicly stated that they are close to a deal with the US and that a signing is just days away. This info, combined with Biden’s recent statements that they are working hard to lower prices at the pump can only mean one thing: Iran is going to start supplying the United States with oil. Iran, in case you people don’t know, is one of Russia’s closest allies in the middle east. So as Iran is supplying oil at the pump, Russia is going to start whispering ideas into Iran’s ear, trying to use them as a middleman in order to push Russia’s agenda into Washington via shady lobbying dollars.

Also, on a side note, Iran selling oil is really going to piss off the Saudis since they are sworn enemies. This matters a lot because Saudi Arabia, via an agreement in the 1970s, has agreed to trade their oil exclusively in USD, meaning the USD is NOT a true fiat currency, hence we can print so much without real consequence. This means the US needs to find a way to placate them. This would most likely mean the US will have to take part in additional wars in the middle east to help the Saudis expand their influence, so hooray for that.

One last thing, don’t count too much on shale, Biden’s ban on drilling on federal land just got lifted in December and its unclear how fast US production can pick up. Apparently, betting everything on the multi-trillion-dollar BBB plan with inflation running rampant thinking the country can just seemingly transition to green energy is not the smartest thing to do.

In conclusion, you Americans need to understand that a large chunk of the world doesn’t think the way you do. While the timelines for your objectives typically last until the next election, ours can last years, decades, sometimes even generations if need be. Don’t be too surprised, our countries have thousands of years’ worth of history, while yours started not even 300 years ago. Everything you think of as unfathomable; we have experienced countless times. Revolutions, invasions, dynasties, even genocides. Time has taught us patience, and its time you learned it as well.
