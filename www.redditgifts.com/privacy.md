What's the worst remake of a movie you've ever watched?
Discussion

for me they are

Point break 2015 remake - It's an unnecessary and miserable remake, everything that made the original movie work has been removed from this remake, along with a ridiculous philosophy that is easily one of the worst I've seen in the history Of the movies

Jacob ladder - it's just ridiculous

Psycho 1998 remake - it's just a shot by shot copy of the original movie and with worse actors

Honorable Mention for 2015 Fantastic Four, It's A Reboot But It's A Terrible Movie

Hey r/baseball, I'm the guy who drew Mike Trout for 97 days in a row. AMA
AMA

We made it, baseball is back. Hopefully there's not too much Trout Drawing fatigue by now, but a lot of you have requested this so here it goes. I'll be back in about 20 minutes to start answering your questions

Edit: We're starting now beecause there are already 70 questions you savages

Proof

Edit: It's been real guys! I'm off to go walk my dog

I think I've answered most of the common questions I've been seeing. Thanks for supporting me over the last 97 days!
