To the girl who sent me to hospital and will likely get away with it, fuck you, bitch

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just so angry. I had one of the most humiliating experiences this week

I was in a bar Monday night with some friends and there was this very obnoxious drunk girl. She spilled a couple of our drinks and I got up, very gently put my hand on this girls shoulder and tried to coax her back to her booth. She kicked me in the balls. A hard kick. I fell to the floor and she staggered off laughing as other people laughed. A couple decent bros came over and helped me up, asked if I was ok if I needed ice or anything.

They blew up to the size of like elongated golf balls. They hurt. I had to go to the emergency room and have them drained (apparently this is caused by some build up of fluid during swelling).

All I can remember is that bitch staggering back laughing as others laughed with her

You hurt me. You sent me to HOSPITAL.

I‚Äôll just say it. If I could do that night over again she‚Äôd get a punch. I don‚Äôt even care if I went to jail. Don‚Äôt care what y‚Äôall say. She sent me to the fucking emergency room and found it FUNNY

EDIT: I wasn‚Äôt going to pursue anything since the pain had subsided and I was happy to put this behind me given the embarrassing nature. The copious number of women who have told me I deserved it because they‚Äôre under the belief that putting your hands on someone‚Äôs shoulder to walk them back to their booth is ‚Äúassault‚Äù. I‚Äôm going after her. I am going to get the video ASAP, I have photo evidence of my swollen balls and witnesses. Fuck you for telling me I deserved this, specifically because of you I‚Äôm going after her you utterly contemptible misandrists. How would you feel if a girl told me she was raped after touching a guy and I said she deserved it because touching is assault?

EDIT 2: yes, my bad I shouldn‚Äôt have compared rape to assault, I‚Äôm sorry. How would you feel if a girl put her hand on a dude‚Äôs shoulder and he punched her in the tit?
