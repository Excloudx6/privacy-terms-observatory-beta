What’s the most fucked up sentence you’ve ever read in a book?
spoilers in comments

Something that made you go “damn I can’t believe I read this with my eyes”.

My vote is this passage from A Feast For Crows:

"Ten thousand of your children perished in my palm, Your Grace. Whilst you snored, I would lick your sons off my face and fingers one by one, all pale sticky princes. You claimed your rights, my lord, but in the darkness I would eat your heirs."

Nasty shit. There’s also a bunch in Black Leopard, Red Wolf
